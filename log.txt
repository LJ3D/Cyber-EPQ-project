##### 22/01/22: ##### 
Began writing some stuff for intro section, starting to plan the whole project now.
There are currently 5 sections planned. Introduction, Password protocols, Attacks, Defences, And the conclusion.

The current planned timescales are:
Finish introduction section on: 5/2/22
Finish password protocols section on: 19/2/22
Finish analysis of password datasets on: 5/3/22
Finish attacks section on: 19/3/22
Finish defences section on: 2/4/22
Finish conclusion on: 16/4/22
9 days of extra time to fix any problems and give me some room if i go slow! :D
Final submission due 25/4/22

Current timescales are pretty rough.
2 weeks per section/task should hopefully work out, ideally ill finish some things before the dates listed above.
I will probably work on multiple sections at once when it makes sense (probably most of the time).
Research will take place constantly throughout the production of the report.

"Finishing" a section doesnt mean i wont change anything written in it later ;)
