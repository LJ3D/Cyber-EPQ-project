########## 22/01/22 ##########
Began writing some stuff for intro + password protocols section, starting to plan the whole project now.
There are currently 5 sections planned. Introduction, Password protocols, Attacks, Defences, And the conclusion.

The current planned timescales are:
Introduction section {STARTED}
>Start by:
>Finish by: 5/2/22
Password protocols section {STARTED}
>Start by:
>Finish by: 19/2/22
Analysis of password datasets
>start by:
>Finish by: 5/3/22
Attacks section
>Start by:
>Finish by: 19/3/22
Defences section
>Start by:
>Finish by: 2/4/22
Conclusion
>Start by:
>Finish by: 16/4/22

9 days of extra time to fix any problems and give me some room if i go slow.
The final submission is due 25/4/22

Current timescales are pretty rough, and dont have any specific start dates.
2 weeks per section/task should hopefully work out, ideally ill finish some things before the dates listed above.
I will probably work on multiple sections at once when it makes sense (probably most of the time).
Research will take place constantly throughout the production of the report.

"Finishing" a section doesnt mean i wont change anything written in it later.
