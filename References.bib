  organization={Citeseer},
  evaluation={This paper provided me with the information I needed to detail how the secure remote password protocol worked. There were some aspects I did not like about this paper though, such as the confusing use of some symbols (some symbols were used to represent two things at once!), and the use of names to represent the client and the server. I changed these things when I wrote about how the SRP protocol works.}
