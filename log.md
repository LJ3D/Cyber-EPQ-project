Began writing some stuff for intro + password protocols section, starting to plan the whole project now.
There are currently 5 sections planned. Introduction, Password protocols, Attacks, Defences, And the conclusion.

The current planned timescales are:

* Introduction section {STARTED}
  * Start by:
  * Finish by: 5/2/22
* Password protocols section {STARTED}
  * Start by:
  * Finish by: 19/2/22
* Analysis of password datasets
  * start by:
  * Finish by: 5/3/22
* Attacks section
  * Start by:
  * Finish by: 19/3/22
* Defences section
  * Start by:
  * Finish by: 2/4/22
* Conclusion
  * Start by:
  * Finish by: 16/4/22

9 days of extra time to fix any problems and give me some room if i go slow.
The final submission is due 25/4/22.

Current timescales are pretty rough, and dont have any specific start dates.
2 weeks per section/task should hopefully work out, ideally ill finish some things before the dates listed above.
I will probably work on multiple sections at once when it makes sense (probably most of the time).
Research will take place constantly throughout the production of the report.
"Finishing" a section doesnt mean i wont change anything written in it later.



## 23/01/22
Did a bunch of stuff to the password protocols section, decided i may as well add some "start by" dates.

The current planned timescales are:
* Introduction section {STARTED}
  * Start by: asap
  * Finish by: 5/2/22
* Password protocols section {STARTED}
  * Start by: 5/2/22
  * Finish by: 19/2/22
* Analysis of password datasets
  * start by: 19/2/22
  * Finish by: 5/3/22
* Attacks section
  * Start by: 5/3/22
  * Finish by: 19/3/22
* Defences section
  * Start by: 19/3/22
  * Finish by: 2/4/22
* Conclusion
  * Start by: 2/4/22
  * Finish by: 16/4/22
9 days extra time
Final submission 25/4/22

Considering merging the "attacks" and "defences" section into one, something along the lines of "vulnerabilities and solutions".
Each vulnerability can then be a subsection with two subsubsections, one describing the attack and the other describing the measures required to protect against the attack.
Ill decide once i properly start that section of the project.

Had quick meeting with big eggleman, he clarified a couple things.
Apparently the final submission date of 25/4/22 also needs all his marking done, so really the project needs to be done maybe a week before the 25th.
Changed intro section finish date.

The current planned timescales are:
* Introduction section {STARTED}
  * Start by: asap
  * Finish by: 16/4/22
* Password protocols section {STARTED}
  * Start by: 5/2/22
  * Finish by: 19/2/22
* Analysis of password datasets
  * start by: 19/2/22
  * Finish by: 5/3/22
* Attacks section
  * Start by: 5/3/22
  * Finish by: 19/3/22
* Defences section
  * Start by: 19/3/22
  * Finish by: 2/4/22
* Conclusion
  * Start by: 2/4/22
  * Finish by: 16/4/22




## 28/01/22
Added hashcat to the plan, "analysis of password datasets" from the previous outline did include using hashcat, but specifically mentioning it makes it clearer

The current planned timescales are:
* Introduction section {STARTED}
  * Start by: asap
  * Finish by: 16/4/22
* Password protocols section {STARTED}
  * Start by: 5/2/22
  * Finish by: 19/2/22
* Analysis of password datasets & hashcat stuff
  * start by: 19/2/22
  * Finish by: 5/3/22
* Attacks section
  * Start by: 5/3/22
  * Finish by: 19/3/22
* Defences section
  * Start by: 19/3/22
  * Finish by: 2/4/22
* Conclusion
  * Start by: 2/4/22
  * Finish by: 16/4/22

## 23/02/22
Renamed things, i think "Vulnerabilites" and "Mitigations" is better than "Attacks" and "Defences"
Analysis is now specified to be its own section.

  * Finish by: 16/4/22
* Password protocols section {STARTED} {90+% COMPLETE}
  * Finish by: 19/2/22
* Analysis of password datasets & hashcat stuff + writeup into its own section {STARTED}

* Vulnerabilities section
  * Finish by: 19/3/22
* Presentation
  * Will happen on: 28/3/22
* Mitigations section
  * Finish by: 2/4/22
* Conclusion
  * Finish by: 16/4/22
* End of project review
  * Do by: 18/4/22

  * Hand in by: 18/4/22
* Final submission to Qufaro
  * Submit by: 25/4/22



## 02/03/22
Since the last entry, I have mostly been writing the code for the dataset analysis. This included:
* Writing code to check if a password contains a certain type of character.
* Breaking C++ code down into header files.
* Writing python programs for graphing/debugging purposes.
Changes to the report itself have been very minimal.



## 11/03/22
Since the last entry:
* Finished C++ dataset analysis code and performed the dataset analysis.
* Wrote hashcat shell script to perform the password cracking analysis.
* Added the results from the password cracking analysis into the report.
* Wrote about my password cracking analysis in the report, along with other password-related information.
* Some evaluation of resources.



## 23/03/22
Since the last entry:
* Added a couple of images to the report (screenshots related to analysis).
* Moved some stuff into tables for the password cracking section to make it look much better.
* Some other small additions (a few paragraphs) to various parts of the report.



## 10/04/22
Since the last entry:
* Wrote about password security misconceptions.
* Moved more stuff into tables.
* Wrote about addressing password security misconceptions.
* Wrote about phishing, SQL injection, and man-in-the-middle attacks.



## 17/04/22
Well, things got a bit messy in terms of my tracking of timescales for this project, and i have not yet done my presentation due to being ill during the week it was supposed to take place, but at least i have my project 99% finished now.
Since the last entry:
* Wrote about phishing detection.
* Wrote about mitigations for injecton and database compromise, as well as MITM attacks
* Rearranged the vulnerabilities section, moved it before the dataset/password cracking analysis
* Improved dataset analysis writeup.
* Started writing the conclusion.
