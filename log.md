Began writing some stuff for intro + password protocols section, starting to plan the whole project now.
There are currently 5 sections planned. Introduction, Password protocols, Attacks, Defences, And the conclusion.

The current planned timescales are:

* Introduction section {STARTED}
  * Start by:
  * Finish by: 5/2/22
* Password protocols section {STARTED}
  * Start by:
  * Finish by: 19/2/22
* Analysis of password datasets
  * start by:
  * Finish by: 5/3/22
* Attacks section
  * Start by:
  * Finish by: 19/3/22
* Defences section
  * Start by:
  * Finish by: 2/4/22
* Conclusion
  * Start by:
  * Finish by: 16/4/22

9 days of extra time to fix any problems and give me some room if i go slow.
The final submission is due 25/4/22.

Current timescales are pretty rough, and dont have any specific start dates.
2 weeks per section/task should hopefully work out, ideally ill finish some things before the dates listed above.
I will probably work on multiple sections at once when it makes sense (probably most of the time).
Research will take place constantly throughout the production of the report.
"Finishing" a section doesnt mean i wont change anything written in it later.



## 23/01/22
Did a bunch of stuff to the password protocols section, decided i may as well add some "start by" dates.

The current planned timescales are:
* Introduction section {STARTED}
  * Start by: asap
  * Finish by: 5/2/22
* Password protocols section {STARTED}
  * Start by: 5/2/22
  * Finish by: 19/2/22
* Analysis of password datasets
  * start by: 19/2/22
  * Finish by: 5/3/22
* Attacks section
  * Start by: 5/3/22
  * Finish by: 19/3/22
* Defences section
  * Start by: 19/3/22
  * Finish by: 2/4/22
* Conclusion
  * Start by: 2/4/22
  * Finish by: 16/4/22
9 days extra time
Final submission 25/4/22

Considering merging the "attacks" and "defences" section into one, something along the lines of "vulnerabilities and solutions".
Each vulnerability can then be a subsection with two subsubsections, one describing the attack and the other describing the measures required to protect against the attack.
Ill decide once i properly start that section of the project.

Had quick meeting with big eggleman, he clarified a couple things.
Apparently the final submission date of 25/4/22 also needs all his marking done, so really the project needs to be done maybe a week before the 25th.

* Introduction section {STARTED}
